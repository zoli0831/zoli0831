## Hi there 👋

I'm currently a **PhD student** :mortar_board: at EPFL in Switzerland :switzerland: in the groups of [Beat Fierz](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lcbm/fierz/). My research interests lie in the structural and mechanism studies of Histone Modifications and their regulators, such as Polycomb Repressive Complex.
